# Teddy.ai: Your Companion for a Brighter Future! 🌟

## Inspiration 🌈

According to mentalhealth.uk, over 45% of children asked said they felt lonely 'often' or 'some of the time'. 

That is way too high in our team's opinion.

At Teddy.ai, our inspiration is simple yet powerful: to ensure that no child or individual ever feels lonely. We believe in harnessing the potential of technology to create companionship, connection, and a brighter future for everyone. 🤗

## What It Does 🐻

Teddy.ai is not just a teddy bear; it's a gateway to a world of possibilities. 🌌

- It leverages the blockchain to introduce children to concepts like NFTs and FLOW tokens through fun and interactive experiences, while also leveraging Starknet to ensure privacy and scalability. 🧸🔗
- Teddy.ai is your child's snuggable best friend who understands them, rewards positive behavior, and ensures no child feels alone. 🎉
- With Teddy.ai, you can now seamlessly integrate your social media links and personal websites, allowing the bear to know all the details about its owner's life. It's like having a friend who truly understands you! 📱🌐

## How We Built It 🛠️

We built Teddy.ai with a combination of cutting-edge technologies:

- **Verbwire API**: Utilized for minting NFTs of precious memories in real-time. 🖼️
- **Flow Blockchain**: Integrated to enable transactions through speech, making it accessible for children. 🗣️
- **OpenAI Language Models (LLMs)**: Utilized OpenAI's language models for understanding and responding to users. 🤖
- **OpenAI Whisper**: Employed for Speech-to-Text (STT) functionality. 🎤
- **Beautiful Soup**: Used for web scraping to gather information. 🕸️
- **Elevenlabs**: Leveraged for Text-to-Speech (TTS) capabilities. 🔊
- **OpenCV**: Captured memories with a user's webcam. 📸
- **Sounddevice**: Recorded audio from interaction between the user and their teddy. 🎶
- **Starknet**: Leveraged Starknet mainnet to mint unique Teddy Bear NFTs for each teddy bear, immutably recording their owner on the blockchain. 

## Challenges We Ran Into 🚧

During our journey, we faced several challenges, including:

- Working with Cadence as well as Flow Client Library for the first time. 💻
- Getting Flow transactions working in JavaScript and integrating them with our Python background. 🤯
- Integrating Starknet with the rest of our software given the intensive implementation necessary. 🧩

## Accomplishments That We're Proud Of 🏆

Our proudest accomplishments include:

- Successfully integrating web3 features seamlessly with our backend. 🌐
- Lowering the barrier so that even children can mint NFTs and send blockchain transactions. 🚀
- Integrating audio and video capture to make Teddy.ai a reality. 🎥🔊

## What We Learned 📚

First, working with Flow and Starknet for the first time was a significant learning experience for us, and it has enriched our understanding of blockchain technology. 🤓

In addition, integrating the frontend and backend proved to be quite the challenge. We were able to do so, but it took many hours. Thankfully, we were able to do so just in time for the hackathon submission deadline. 🕰️

Finally, we really love working with the new OpenAI Assistants and function calling APIs - we were able to streamline processes that would otherwise be incredibly complicated. 🤖

## What's Next For Teddy.ai 🚀

The journey has just begun! We envision Teddy.ai becoming a global symbol of companionship and learning. We'll continue to enhance its capabilities, expand its educational features, and explore new horizons in technology and education. Our mission remains clear: to ensure that no one ever feels alone, and that Teddy.ai is there to provide comfort, connection, and a bright future for all. 🌍💖

Join us on this exciting journey to redefine companionship and education with Teddy.ai! 🐻💡
