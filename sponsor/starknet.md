[MLH] Best Use of Starknet
Starknet Care Package + a ticket to a Starknet sponsored Web3 conference of your choice

Starknet is a general-purpose network where you can write and deploy your own smart contracts and interact with other contracts just like Ethereum. Build your application around Starknet using Rust or Python for your backend infrastructure, Starknet DSL for smart contract development, and React / JavaScript for your front end user interface. There are several SDKs available for you to choose from, making integrating Starknet into your hackathon project a breeze.

Use Starknet in your project this weekend for a chance to win a Starknet care package, including a backpack, socks, water bottle, and a ticket to a Starknet sponsored Web3 conference of your choice!

We use starknet to mint a unique Teddy Bear NFT for every single teddy bear that immutably states its owner on chain. The Teddy.ai Bear NFTs will be part of an NFT collection on Starknet with 1 NFT for every Teddy.ai Bear and its owner. 


- Teddy.ai qualifies for the Starknet prize by leveraging Starknet to mint unique Teddy Bear NFTs for each teddy bear, immutably recording their owner on the blockchain.
- We intend to utilize Starknet to create a one-of-a-kind NFT collection on the Starknet network, enhancing the ownership and authenticity of Teddy.ai companions with the loyalties going to support Children Charity organizations.
